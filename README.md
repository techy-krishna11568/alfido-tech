Java Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Java programming exercises .

---

## üöÄ Key Learning Areas:

* **Java SE Basics:** Understanding the foundational elements of Java programming.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** Practical implementation of classes, objects, inheritance, and method overriding.
* **File Handling:** Learning how to read and interact with external files.
* **Exception Handling:** Implementing robust code to gracefully manage errors and unexpected situations.

---

## üìã Tasks Included:

1.  **Hello World Program:**
    * A classic starting point: a simple Java program to print "Hello, World!" to the console, demonstrating basic syntax and compilation.

2.  **Simple Calculator Program:**
    * Develop a console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This task focuses on user input, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic.

3.  **OOP with Classes Demonstration:**
    * Explore Object-Oriented Programming by creating a Java program that illustrates the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and the concept of method overriding.

4.  **File Reader Application:**
    * Write a Java program to read the contents of a text file and display them on the console. This task introduces file input/output operations and basic exception handling for file-related issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run:

To run these Java programs, you will need:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher** installed on your system.
* A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions) or a command-line interface.
